# Pantry Pirate

## Team Members: 

Adrienne Frey, Joe Davitt, Jordan Covington, Jeremy Cleland, Steve Gant

## Web Application

Utilizing the Amazon API, we created a mobile application that allows users to scan barcodes and retrieve the item's data to then store either in a shopping list or in their personal pantry. Need to have a shared shopping list or pantry? Our app allows users to add members to either, making it possible to know both what is currently in the  pantry at home while out shopping and also the list of items still  needed.

### User Stories

1. As a family member who rotates who does grocery shopping, I would like to share a shopping list with people in my group to easily send a checklist.

2. As a busy homeowner, I want an easy-to-use mobile application to help me keep track of my pantry inventory.

3. As a busy parent shopping for my family, I want to be able to scan a barcode or input an item by description to add to shopping list. 

4. As a user I want a mobile application that allows me to find the best deals so that I can save time and money while managing my groceries.

5. As a user, I want a mobile application that allows me to create groups that are able to share shopping lists.
